Section 3 - What is Incident Handling

incident Handling is the preparation, detection, management and resolution of incidents of events that may occur in the information system. 
Operationally, you can think of incident Handling or an incident handler, as the person/process/protocol that guides a security team throughthe 
lifecycle necessary to resolve events or incidentas they occure. these steps are typically drafted and approved by some sort of govering body
beforehand taht has a vasted interest in seeing the situation resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible.

let's walk through a short scenario and identidy th security event, and possible security incident:
  - an endpoint locally logging an enterprise user authenticating to it during normal business hours - (security event)
  - that same user opening a shell session using their user account and previleges - (security event)
  - the user elevates their privileges within the shell session to those of adminisrator - (security event possible security incident)
  - the user leverages the administrator previleges within the shll to download an executable from the interenet and install it on 
    the endpoint - (security event possible security incident)
  - the executable installs successfuly due to having adminisrator previleges, and begins encrypting all files and folders on 
    the endpoint with an unknown encryption set - (security incident)

Section 4 - Difference between Incident Handling and Incindent Response

incident handling and incident response work very closely with each other, and may very well be two separate duites of the same person.
incident response is the operational and technical response to a situatio, while incident handling is the logistical and communicative
hub of the effort. it may seem like these are one in the same, but it is critically important to define these roles and their expected 
outputs within your incident response plan. failure to clearly dictate ehat is expected of both can easily result in a securityi incident
quickly spiraling out of control as the scope creeps for either.

incident response is the "boots on the ground". this is the skill and technical proficiency thath is necessary to understand what detection 
tools are saying and the needen processes to return an environment back to working order. it is typically staffed with subject matter experts 
that know the network and environment well, and can manupulate the dedicated tooling to stay apprised of anything happening there.

incident handlings the organization and authority that allows incident response to happen without interruption, but also provides oversight
and makes sure all the boxes get checked. while incident responders may know the technical path to resolution, incident handlers know the 
dependencies requires to make it happen. the staff must be able to both understand the technical data coming from the incident response side, 
and effectively communicate that to other vasted peronnel.

Section 5 - The Incindent Response Process

an incident response prossess encompasses all the action from the prparation, to inotoa detection of the incindent, to final closure.
there are multiple framewoks to choose from, some are a four-step process, some have more, but they generally include the following:

    1. preparation
    2. detection and analysis
    3. containment, eradication, recovery 
    4. post-incident activity 

these four steps represnt the NIST incident response process. As stated before, there are other frameworks, and you should choose 
the one that most suits your organization's needs. all of the framewoks follow these general steps however, so let's go through what each represents:

  1. preparation - this step represent the identification and collection of all relevant security information, the creation and
     dissemination of all communication requirements and timelines, and the culmination of all of that into an adopted and tested incident response plan. 
     this step should include some of the following:
     
      - identifying and enumerating all assets in your environment
      - categorizing thos assets using a criticality rating 
      - baseline and record assets behavior and communications 
      - setting a theshold for security event and security incident 
      - creating and publishing a communcations plan 

  2. detection and analysis - this step represents the first actions beyond preparaton, wich means within context, that this is the first step after
     an incident has been discovered. during this step, all of the recorded data for affected assets should be analyzed to determine the extent of the
     incident. the communications plan will be initiated to notify any stakeholders, and the incident response team will initialize the incident
     responseplan. some of the actions that will take place during this step:
     
      - retrieve, analyze, and store any data related to the incident 
      - initialize the communications plan
      - initialize the incident response and incident handling plans and teams
      - determine the beginning and extent of the incident

  3. containment, eradication, recovery - once the extent of the incindent has been determined, this step aims to prevent further spread or loss, 
     remove the vectors that allowed the incident to propagate, and return the involved assets to operational order. the following are actions that 
     are typical during this step: 
     
      - firewall, IDS, or other toll Deny actions 
      - network or endpoint isolation
      - authentication removal or lock 
      - endpoint or server wipes and rebuilds 
      - kerberos key re-generation

  4. post-incident activity - this step represent the final action before returing to the preparation phase. the goal of this step os to critically 
     and holistically review all of the plans, procedures, and actions taken, then distill all of that information inro making the preparation process
     hadened against future recurrence. some of the data and associated outputs possible include:
     
      - using the incident data to harden infrastrukture
      - adapting the incident timelin for future simulated scenarios
      - reviewing and improving the communications plan
      - generating more precise alering based on incident data
      - reviewing and altering tem actions based on incident response effectiveness
    
the NIST incident response process is highly regarded as one of the best and encompassing baseline framewok. while it containts a great starting point 
on organizing and implementing this process, you should always adapt these to your own uses. the goal of all of this documentation is always the same:
safe and afficient resolutions to all security incidents so taht whatever you are protectiong can resume operations with as little negative impact 
as possible.
